## Botanical Injection Analysis

The goal of this assignment is to implement a basic analysis of textual 
data using Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org) and 
Dask (https://dask.org). 

### DATASET

We will study a dataset provided by the city of Montreal that contains 
the list of trees treated against the emerald ash borer 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer). The dataset is 
described at 
http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/frenes-publics-proteges-injection-agrile-du-frene 
(use Google translate to translate from French to English). 

We will use the 2015 and 2016 data sets available in directory `data`.

## Movie Recommender System based on Ratings

With this assignment you will get a practical hands-on of recommender
systems in Spark. To begin, make sure you understand the example
at http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-collaborative-filtering.html
and that you can run it successfully. 

We will use the MovieLens dataset sample provided with Spark and
available in directory `data`.

## Plant-State Frequent Item Set & Clustering

In this assignment, frequency of different plants in US states are is analyzed using PySpark. In addition, the states are group together geographically based on plant types that appear in each state.

## Plant-State Similarity Signature

In this assignment, plants that have similar signature, created based on min-hashed values of the states in which the plants appear, are grouped together using PySpark.
